This isn't a full project (yet?), which is why the read me and file structure is not easy 

Steps to run - 

git clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/tj5miniop/arch-amd-configs)
cd into it 
make the install.sh file executable (chmod +x ./install.sh)

Run install.sh as ROOT user (sudo ./install.sh)
